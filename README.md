# Enhanced thematic clustering of publications

The Lab-STICC has different teams working on various areas from computer science to digital sciences. One division, called Interaction, has three teams: COMMEDIA, INUIT, and RAMBO. They focus on making technology better for users. Because the teams have different expertise and technology changes fast, they shuffle team members every five years to match everyone's interests. This project aims to enhance the shuffling process for division members.
